Additional Requirements

1. Relation between Client and Library Items:

Establish a relationship between Client and LibraryItem where a client can rent or borrow items.

Each Client should have a collection of borrowed library items.



2. Borrow/Rent Feature:

Add a stock property to each library item to manage multiple copies of the same item.

Alternatively, manage a single copy per item with an availability property (boolean or enum).

Add two methods in the menu:

borrowItem(userId, itemId): Allows a client to borrow an item.

returnItem(itemId, userId): Allows a client to return an item.




3. Use of Streams:

Use Java streams for operations such as filtering library items or finding a client by ID.

Ensure streams are used wherever applicable for efficiency and simplicity.



4. Validations:

Ensure unique IDs across all entities (LibraryItem and Client).

Validate user input, such as checking for item availability or verifying client and item IDs before processing requests.

BONUS

5. Interfaces:

Create a CRUD interface implemented by both LibraryItem and Client.

Define methods like create, read, update, and delete in the interface.



6. User-Friendly Menu:

Design a clear and user-friendly menu system with descriptive instructions.

Include meaningful error messages for invalid operations.
