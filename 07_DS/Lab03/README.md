# Lab 03: Searching and Sorting

This lab covers various searching and sorting algorithms implemented on Linked Lists.

## Contents

- **[SearchingAlgorithms(LinkedList)](./SearchingAlgorithms(LinkedList))**: Implementation of searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search) on Linked Lists.
- **[SotringAlgorithms(LinkedList)](./SotringAlgorithms(LinkedList))**: Implementation of sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort) on Linked Lists.

## Usage

Navigate to each directory to verify the implementation and run the main programs to see the algorithms in action.
